# CakePHP 2 Project (2020)

This repository showcases a web application I worked on in 2020, shortly after graduating from university. Built using CakePHP 2, the project served as a backend of a **food delivery platform** at the time but is now inactive. I uploaded the code here to preserve and reflect on my early work as a developer. During this project, I had to learn CakePHP on the job to make the project work.

## Project Overview

- **Framework**: CakePHP 2
- **Language**: PHP 7.x
- **Status**: Inactive

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive, documenting my early development efforts. While it isn't a complete, deployable application, it offers a glimpse into my learning process and the technologies I used at the time.

## Setup Instructions

To explore the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install PHP 7.x**: The project was built using PHP 7.x for compatibility.
2. **Download CakePHP 2.x**: Obtain the CakePHP 2.x core files from [CakePHP's website](https://book.cakephp.org/2.x/en/) and place them in the `lib/` directory.
3. **Configure the Database**: Set up the database connection in `app/Config/database.php`. Sensitive data has been removed for privacy reasons.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: CakePHP 2.x
- **Language**: PHP 7.x
- **Database**: MySQL

## Lessons Learned

This project provided valuable experience in:
- Implementing a REST API using CakePHP.
- Developing dynamic web applications.
- Managing relational databases.

## Additional Information

Please note that CakePHP 2 was not my technology of choice at the time; it was already in use when I joined the company. Additionally, the application was not developed entirely by me. The company had a backend built on CakePHP 2, but much of the functionality did not meet the company’s needs. I had to rewrite about **90% of the code** to tailor it to the company’s specific requirements. Despite this, I was able to work with the framework and gain valuable insights into PHP-based web application development.
